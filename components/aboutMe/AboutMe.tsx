          Hi! My name is Dario Ontiveros and I come from Buenos Aires,
          Argentina. ðŸ‘‹ I am a FullStack Developer, mostly working in Mobile
          with React Native, but I have worked with React.Js and Node.Js I have
          7 years of experience working in the ðŸŽ¥ Movies and Advertising
          Industry. This taught me all about working in teams, how to lead and
          how to be led. It gave me a sense of what it means to work in
          projects, defining strategies, establishing deadlines and having a
          common goal.
        </p>
