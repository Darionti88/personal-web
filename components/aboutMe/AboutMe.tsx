          Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Dario Ontiveros and I come from Buenos Aires,
          Argentina. I am a FullStack Developer, mostly working in Mobile with
          React Native, but I also work with React and Node.Js. 7 years working
          in the ðŸŽ¥ Movies and Advertising Industry taught me all about working
          in teams, how to lead and how to be led. It gave me a sense of what it
          means to work in projects, defining strategies, establishing deadlines
          and having a common goals.
        </p>
