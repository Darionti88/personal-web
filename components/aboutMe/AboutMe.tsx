        Hi! My name is Dario Ontiveros and I come from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
        ðŸ‘‹ I am a FullStack Developer, mostly working in Mobile with React
        Native, but I have worked with React.Js and Node.Js I have 7 years of
        experience working in the ðŸŽ¥ Movies and Advertising Industry. This
        taught me all about working in ams, how to lead and how to be led. It
        gave me a sense of what it means to work in projects, defining
        strategies, establishing deadlines and having a common goal.
